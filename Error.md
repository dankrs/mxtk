# MXTK/USDT Pool Position Closure Issue Report

## Issue Overview
A liquidity crisis has occurred in the MXTK/USDT Uniswap V3 pool where all USDT liquidity has been removed, resulting in:
- Remaining MXTK liquidity: 0.037 MXTK
- Remaining USDT liquidity: 0
- Current displayed price: 340,257,000,000,000,000,000,000.00 MXTK per USDT
- Pool state: Out of range

## Impact
- Position holders cannot close their positions due to the absence of USDT liquidity
- The extreme price skew prevents normal position management
- The UI only allows additional MXTK deposits, which cannot resolve the situation

## Technical Details
- Contract Address (Position Manager): 0xC36442b4a4522E871399CD717aBDD847Ab11FE88
- Error encountered when attempting position closure:
```
Error: cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit
Reason: "execution reverted: TF"
```

## Attempted Solutions
1. Verified account status:
   - Confirmed neither address is frozen (0xC36442b4a4522E871399CD717aBDD847Ab11FE88, 0xb36C15f1ED5cedb9E913218219016d8Cf5Ac864F)
   - Confirmed gas fee settings are properly configured

2. Attempted liquidity addition:
   - UI prevents USDT liquidity addition due to extreme price imbalance
   - Only allows MXTK addition, which cannot resolve the price disparity

## Technical Constraints
1. Position closure fails due to:
   - Inability to calculate accurate prices with zero USDT liquidity
   - Potential division by zero in price calculations
   - Break in V3's price range mechanics

## Requested Assistance
We are seeking guidance on:
1. Potential emergency procedures for position closure in zero-liquidity situations
2. Technical approaches to restore pool functionality
3. Best practices for preventing similar situations in future deployments

## Additional Context
- The MXTK contract includes standard ERC20 functionality with transfer fee mechanisms
- All relevant contract security checks are passing
- Position holders' accounts are verified as active and unfrozen
